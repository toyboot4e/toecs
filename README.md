# Toy ECS

Just for my learning; use other ECS libraries for real projects!

## Thanks

I learned from..

* [sparsey]. The clean code in short lines opened my mind to ECS.
* [ECS back and forth][ebaf] series. They gave me explicit explanation of tricks behind [sparsey].
* [shipyard]. It shows solid code structure, still keeping the simplicity.
* [bevy]. It is full of goodies for humans.
* [legion]. I learned some ser/de approach from the `serialize` module.
